Summary:
Big Thanks to VLAD-MARIUS ( https://www.thingiverse.com/VLAD-MARIUS/about ) for publishing his lego compatible basic bricks!I repaired the broken meshes with Microsoft's Builder and filled the holes under the knobs. I also enforced the 1x? bricks. Now all the Bricks are way more FDM printer friendly!The bricks are similar with the brick numbers shown.The "L" means that the brick is large ( 1 large brick = 3 small bricks ) .The "S" means that the brick is small ( 3 small bricks = 1 large brick) .--&gt; i personally wasn't able to print the small bricks very well because of big bridging issues. if you succeed, please let us know how you did it !!See the Original Models for further Information and give the author some credit:published by VLAD-MARIUSLEGO Brick 1x1 - large [Nr. 302201] - www.thingiverse.com/thing:879108LEGO Brick 1x1 - small [Nr. 302401] - www.thingiverse.com/thing:825015LEGO Brick 1x2 - large [Nr. 300401] - www.thingiverse.com/thing:1007112LEGO Brick 1x2 - small [Nr. 302301] - www.thingiverse.com/thing:1002522LEGO Brick 1x3 - large [Nr. 362201] - www.thingiverse.com/thing:1496588LEGO Brick 1x3 - small [Nr. 362301] - www.thingiverse.com/thing:1331072LEGO Brick 1x4 - large [Nr. 301001] - www.thingiverse.com/thing:2216171LEGO Brick 1x4 - small [Nr. 371001] - www.thingiverse.com/thing:2098258LEGO Brick 2x2 - large [Nr. 300301] - www.thingiverse.com/thing:1219050LEGO Brick 2x2 - small [Nr. 302201] - www.thingiverse.com/thing:1146407LEGO Brick 2x3 - large [Nr. 300201] - www.thingiverse.com/thing:1647473LEGO Brick 2x3 - small [Nr. 302101] - www.thingiverse.com/thing:1576035LEGO Brick 2x4 - large [Nr. 300101] - www.thingiverse.com/thing:2216285LEGO Brick 2x4 - small [Nr. 302001] - www.thingiverse.com/thing:1765509
